# macOS-optimized base requirements (no CUDA)
# ================================================
# This file is optimized for macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)
# PyTorch will automatically use Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend on Apple Silicon
#
# IMPORTANT: Python 3.11.9 is RECOMMENDED for best stability
# While Python 3.13.x is supported, 3.11.9 has better compatibility with scikit-learn
# and all data science packages.
#
# Usage:
#   # Setup Python 3.11.9 first (recommended)
#   pyenv install 3.11.9
#   pyenv local 3.11.9
#   ~/.pyenv/versions/3.11.9/bin/python -m venv venv
#   source venv/bin/activate
#
#   # Then install requirements
#   pip install -r requirements/base-macos.txt
#   pip install -r requirements/observability.txt
#   pip install -r requirements/encryption.txt
#
# For AI features (optional):
#   pip install -r requirements/ai_requirements.txt
#
# Last Updated: October 10, 2025
# Python Version: 3.11.9 recommended (3.13.x supported but may have issues)

# macOS-specific notes:
# - NVIDIA CUDA packages have been removed from base.txt (not available on macOS)
# - PyTorch uses MPS backend on Apple Silicon for GPU acceleration
# - TensorFlow/Keras work with CPU optimizations
# - All security updates are included in base.txt
