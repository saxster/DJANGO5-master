please fix all the linter errors in rules.md

I'll help you fix the linter errors in the `rules.md` file. Let me first read the current file to see what issues need to be addressed. Let me continue reading the file to see the rest of the content: Let me continue reading to see more of the file: Let me continue reading the file to see the full content: Let me continue reading to see the rest: Let me read the rest of the file: Let me read the final part of the file: Now let me check for linter errors in this file. I'll use the get_errors tool to see what specific issues need to be fixed: I can see there are many linter errors related to:
1. **MD022**: Headings should be surrounded by blank lines
2. **MD009**: Trailing spaces 
3. **MD032**: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines
4. **MD031**: Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines

Let me fix all these errors systematically using the multi_replace_string_in_file tool: 
```

```

```

```
I need to continue fixing the remaining linter errors. Let me fix Rules 6-10: 
```

```
Let me continue fixing Rules 8-10: 
```

```
Let me continue fixing the remaining linter errors for Rules 10-15: 
```

```
Let me continue fixing Rules 13-18: 
```

```
Let me continue fixing the remaining issues. I need to fix the code blocks in Rule 15 and then the lists and headings: 
```

```
Let me continue fixing the remaining issues with Rules 16-18 and the SOLID principles section: 
```

```
Let me finish fixing the remaining issues by addressing the second code block in Rule 17, Rule 18, and the remaining sections: 
```

```
Let me finish fixing the remaining issues: 
```

```
Let me fix the final issues with the Enforcement Checklist section and the file ending: 
```

```
Now let me check if all the linter errors have been fixed: It seems my previous edits didn't take effect for some of the earlier sections. Let me check the current state of the beginning of the file and fix the remaining issues: I can see the issue - the beginning of the file still has the formatting problems. Let me fix the early sections of the file: 
```

```
I need to complete the Rule 2 code block fix and continue with Rule 3. Let me read the current state around that area: Let me fix the remaining issues with Rules 2 and 3: 
```

```
Now let me check the final status of linter errors: There's just one remaining linter error. Let me fix this by converting the emphasized text to a proper heading: [object Object]

Let me do a final check to confirm all linter errors are resolved: Perfect! I have successfully fixed all the linter errors in the `rules.md` file. Here's a summary of what was fixed:

## Summary of Linter Fixes Applied

### 1. **MD022: Headings surrounded by blank lines**
- Added blank lines before and after all section headings (### Rule X:, ## sections, etc.)

### 2. **MD009: Trailing spaces**
- Removed trailing spaces from list items and other lines

### 3. **MD032: Lists surrounded by blank lines**
- Added blank lines before and after all bulleted and numbered lists

### 4. **MD031: Fenced code blocks surrounded by blank lines**
- Added blank lines before and after all ```python code blocks

### 5. **MD026: No trailing punctuation in headings**
- Removed colons from heading titles (e.g., "Pre-commit Checks:" → "Pre-commit Checks")

### 6. **MD036: Emphasis used instead of heading**
- Converted **Claude Code MUST ALWAYS** from bold text to a proper ### heading

### 7. **MD047: Single trailing newline**
- Added a single newline character at the end of the file

All linter errors have been resolved while maintaining the document's content, structure, and readability. The `rules.md` file now follows proper Markdown formatting standards and should pass all markdown linters.code blocks
