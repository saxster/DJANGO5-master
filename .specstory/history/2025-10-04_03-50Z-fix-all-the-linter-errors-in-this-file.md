The file `CLAUDE.md` is a Markdown documentation file, not a code file. Linter errors in Markdown typically refer to formatting issues such as inconsistent heading levels, trailing spaces, line length, improper code block usage, or other style violations.

To proceed, I will:
- Clean up common Markdown linter issues: heading consistency, trailing whitespace, code block formatting, and list formatting.
- Ensure the document is well-structured and readable.

I will now apply these improvements to the file. 
```

```
All trailing whitespace and related Markdown linter errors have been cleaned up in `CLAUDE.md`. If you have a specific Markdown linter or want further style improvements (like heading levels, line length, or list formatting), let me know!

```

```
All heading-level linter errors inside code blocks have been fixed in `CLAUDE.md`. Headings within code blocks are now replaced with comments or proper formatting, as required by Markdown linting standards.

If you want further cleanup (like line length, list formatting, or other Markdown style rules), let me know!

All trailing whitespace and blank line linter errors have been cleaned up in `CLAUDE.md`. The file should now comply with standard Markdown linting rules. If you need checks for other Markdown style issues, let me know!
