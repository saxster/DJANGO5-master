A significant performance regression has been detected for the following endpoint.

Endpoint: {{ endpoint }}

Performance Comparison:
                    Baseline    Current     Change
Response Time:      {{ baseline.avg_response_time|floatformat:3 }}s      {{ current.current_response_time|floatformat:3 }}s      {{ current.current_response_time|sub:baseline.avg_response_time|floatformat:3 }}s
Query Count:        {{ baseline.avg_query_count }}          {{ current.current_query_count }}          {{ current.current_query_count|sub:baseline.avg_query_count }}
Avg Query Time:     {{ baseline.avg_query_time|floatformat:3 }}s      {{ current.current_avg_query_time|floatformat:3 }}s      {{ current.current_avg_query_time|sub:baseline.avg_query_time|floatformat:3 }}s

Regression Threshold: {{ regression_threshold }}%

Baseline Information:
- Last Updated: {{ baseline.last_updated }}
- Sample Count: {{ baseline.sample_count }}
- 95th Percentile: {{ baseline.p95_response_time|floatformat:3 }}s

This regression indicates that the endpoint is performing significantly worse than its historical average.

Recommended Actions:
1. Check for recent code deployments or configuration changes
2. Review database query performance for this endpoint
3. Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
4. Check for database locks or blocking queries
5. Review application logs for errors or warnings
